# About this Guide

Open source software is a [Mirror of Erised](https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/the-mirror-of-erised).  It reflects back to each of us what we want to see most.

Deepest desires vary.  While speaking of "open source" writ large, it's easy to ignore its diversity of perspectives and motivations.  Seeing what we want, it's easy to look past our differences, and looking past our differences broadens collaboration.  But inevitably, in conflict, our disparate wants and theories come through.  The reasons we come into open source drive the benefits we try to take out of it.  There we collide.

Motivations to open source, and schools of thought claiming and theorizing open source in those terms, aren't particularly regimented.  Even the oldest self-identified fractions show little like party discipline.  Membership remains fluid and flexible.  Hard-liners remain the exception.  Most participants borrow opportunistically from all the narratives to which they're exposed.

My view reflects my own experience.  Others see things differently.  But I make my own view available here as an aid to open source newcomers starting from nil.  _When open source leads to conflict, I cannot stress enough the importance of understanding others as they are, individually._  Stereotyping thoughts and motives is dangerous.  So ask not:

> To which school of thought does this person belong?

But rather:

> Which views of open source is this person drawing on, and what does that say about what they want?
